abstract: A U.S. Senator from South Dakota donated documents that were accumulated
  during his service as a house representative and senator to be housed at the Bridges
  library at South Dakota State University. This project investigated the utility
  of quantitative statistical methods to explore some portions of this vast document
  collection. The available scanned documents and emails from constituents are analyzed
  using natural language processing methods including the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  (LDA) model. This model identified major topics being discussed in a given collection
  of documents. Important events and popular issues from the Senator Daschles career
  are reflected in the changing topics from the model. These quantitative statistical
  methods provide a summary of the massive amount of text without requiring significant
  human effort or time and can be applied to similar collections.
