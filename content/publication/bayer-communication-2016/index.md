abstract: "During the 20th century, scientists in most forensic subdisciplines reported\
  \ categorical opinions on the source of material recovered in connection with a\
  \ crime. Following the development of DNA evidence, legal and scientific scholars\
  \ have urged these scientists to determine the probative value of forensic evidence\
  \ in a more transparent way and to present conclusions in a fair and balanced fashion.\
  \ Unfortunately, statistical information is not well understood or used rationally\
  \ by most individuals when reasoning. Most jury studies have focused on jurors'\
  \ understanding of reporting techniques currently used by the profession; very few\
  \ studies have attempted to develop novel reporting techniques based on cognitive-psychological\
  \ findings on efficient communication. This study explores some possible reporting\
  \ techniques and describes some of the main challenges of the development and testing\
  \ of novel conclusion presentation methods. Some of our main findings are similar\
  \ to other jury studies. Study participants did not entirely account for the forensic\
  \ evidence when updating their belief that the considered source was in fact the\
  \ true source of the trace, however, participants provided with likelihood ratios\
  \ showed less variability in their answers compared to participants provided with\
  \ categorical conclusions. In addition, we observed a systemic bias against the\
  \ defendant prior to hearing the forensic evidence. Finally, we found that recording\
  \ participants' beliefs involved solving a circular conundrum: measuring the variability\
  \ in the participants' understanding of quantitative information requires the use\
  \ of quantitative scales that they may not all perceive in the same way."
